Hello, world!

I have changed my homepage to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for front-end and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment. The theme Iâ€™m using is [hyde-hyde](https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde).

You can find the source code for this blog in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/EpicEric/ericpires.com.br).
